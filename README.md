# SuperHeroUIPHP

This project is a Super Hero CRUD API sent from a C# backend. Admittedly, PHP is already a server-side language, so a C# backend seems overdone. However, 
this was a fun project for proof of concept. Additionally, this project integrates Google's authentication to validate and create new users to use the service.
The only caveat is that google users cannot be saved to a database. The idea would be to save google users to a database, and native users that have created accounts to another database, 
and perhaps joined the two tables for a query. Such an undertaking may be reserved for a later date for a new project. Furthermore, the styling has not been flushed out for the google authentication.
Nonetheless, this was a fun experiment with APIs and third party identification.
